In this assignment I created a folder in Visual Studio Code, named HTML. I then added 3 new files in the folder, named student-info.txt, report.md and index.html. I modified each file as per instructions in the Lab 1 brief. I use command prompt to configure git.I initialised a Git repository. Repository name is SD-LAB-1. I made 2 commits with descriptive messages "my first commit - committing all file to the repository" and "changed some features" respectively. I then created a branch and named it feature/student-details. Included a commit with the message as per instruction. I run commands on my command prompts to achieve all this.I then deployed my index.html file to GitHub pages. I then submitted a bundled repository.
